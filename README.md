Database: H2 / MySQL Server / Hosting: Localhost
Description: A mobile app created to help people adopt dogs and manage vet records. It connects potential pet owners with a system that tracks user profiles and pet information.
My Contributions: In this project, I built the "brain" of the app (the backend) to make sure user data is saved and managed correctly. My contributions include:
Built the Backend that lets the mobile app talk to the database to create, view, and delete user accounts.
Set up the User System to securely handle details like usernames and passwords.
Created the Data Logic that automatically organizes and saves user information so nothing gets lost.
Managed the Database Connection using Spring Boot to ensure the app stores data reliably.
